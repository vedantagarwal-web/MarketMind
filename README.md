# MarketMind: Neural Prediction Engine for Tech Equities

## Project Overview

MarketMind is a sophisticated LSTM-based prediction system that analyzes historical stock prices, external economic indicators, and tech industry sentiment to forecast stock movements for major technology companies.

### Key Features

- Multi-factor LSTM model incorporating market data and economic indicators
- Sentiment analysis integration from finance news sources
- Interactive visualization dashboard with prediction confidence intervals
- Comprehensive backtesting and model evaluation
- Modular architecture for extensibility and maintenance

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MarketMind.git
cd MarketMind

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
# Example code for running a prediction
from marketmind.models.lstm_model import LSTMPredictor
from marketmind.data_acquisition.stock_data import fetch_stock_data

# Fetch data
data = fetch_stock_data(symbol="AAPL", start_date="2020-01-01")

# Initialize and train model
model = LSTMPredictor()
model.train(data)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(days=30)
```

## Disclaimer

**IMPORTANT**: MarketMind is an educational project developed for demonstrating machine learning techniques in finance. The predictions made by this system should NOT be considered financial advice. Stock markets are inherently volatile and unpredictable, and no algorithm can consistently predict market movements with high accuracy. Users should exercise their own judgment and consult qualified financial advisors before making investment decisions.
